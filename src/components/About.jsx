        My name is Rachel Howard and I have recently found a love for creating applications and trying new technologies to make my projects more interactive and appealing.

        I have found msyelf to be a fast learner and enjoy trying new things. 
        I hope to find myself in a position where I can successfully learn under a great leader and give that same credit back to those who come after me. 
        I would also love to be involved in a project that challenges me and helps me become a better teammate and developer. 
        Any outside projects who needs a new developer eager to learn, feel free to leave me a message below!
